## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

### Apps I like:

- Chineasy (mobile): Straightforward interface where it's easy to find everything. Simple but effective art style.
- Shirable Jisho (mobile): Ability to save and organize information the way I want. Multiple methods of searching for dictionary entries. Extra information within dictionary entries that I can dive into if I want to.
- Freeform (desktop): Quickly jot down information on sticky notes. Paste links in the same space and see link previews. Visually group information together.
- draw.io (web): Able to link different shapes together intelligently. A few pre-made objects for specific use cases.
- WaniKani (web): Incredible brand voice. Sleek interface and simple color scheme with illustrations for intrigue. 

### An app I want to make

I'd like to make a to-do list app for people who struggle with perfectionism and task avoidance. Traditional to-do list apps can become overwhelming when tasks accumulate. The app would have these features:

- Ability to group tasks by value category (e.g. school, career, drawing, pets); each category has a status bar that shows the user how "weak" the category is, allowing the user to focus on which areas of their life need attention rather than fixating on a list of tasks. The user can adjust how quickly the status bar decays and how much a certain task replenishes the bar
- Prompts for overdue tasks asking if the user would like to adjust the due date or scope of the task
- A check-in tool allowing the user to track their mood, particularly as it relates to staying on top of their tasks

## Notes

Had to get used to how Swift handles data types, as well as the specific data types used by UIKit. Changing UI element attributes from the interface builder is a bit overwhelming, would be nice to do with code instead.
